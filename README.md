Hi, I’m @nrojas1, call me Nico

I’m interested in most things Spatial: data manipulation, web-maps representation and other geographical visualisation.

Few stack frameworks and libraries that I'm familiar with:
Leaflet,, Mapbox, D3, Cesium js, Flask, PostGIS, React Ts, Vite, R-shiny

I use this account to host a things I learned at University of Lausanne during my Bsc and Msc in Spatial analysis and complex systems and also learning courses
